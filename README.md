# Expense Tracker App

A Flutter-based mobile app for tracking personal expenses.  
This project helped me build a strong foundation in Flutter, widget management, responsive UI, and state handling.

## 📱 What the App Does
- Add new transactions with title, amount, and date  
- View a list of transactions in a scrollable list  
- Generate a weekly expense chart  
- Display dynamic and responsive layouts (portrait/landscape)  
- Support for both Android and iOS styles (Material & Cupertino widgets)  
- Use of modal bottom sheets for input  
- Custom themes, fonts, and styling for a polished look

## 🛠️ What I Learned
Through building this app, I practiced and understood:
- **Flutter Basics**: Core widgets, widget trees, and composition  
- **Layouts**: Working with `Row`, `Column`, `Container`, `ListView`, `Flexible`, and `Expanded`  
- **Styling**: Text styles, themes, fonts, and colors  
- **User Input**: `TextField`, form handling, and validation  
- **Date Handling**: Using `DatePicker` and formatting with `DateFormat`  
- **State Management**: Updating UI based on user interactions and data changes  
- **Responsive Design**: Using `MediaQuery`, `LayoutBuilder`, and `SafeArea` to adapt UI across devices  
- **Platform Adaptivity**: Incorporating Cupertino widgets for iOS look & feel  
- **Charts**: Looping through lists, building chart bars, and visualizing weekly expenses  
- **Best Practices**: Splitting code into smaller widgets for better maintainability

## 📚 Learning Curve
This project was more than just following a tutorial — I reinforced:
1. How to **design adaptive UIs** that respond to orientation and screen size  
2. How to **map data into widgets dynamically**  
3. How to **work with lists, loops, and conditions** to render UI efficiently  
4. How to **separate concerns** by creating reusable, custom widgets

## 🏁 Next Steps
- Add persistent storage (SQLite / SharedPreferences)  
- Add categories & filtering  
- Explore provider or Riverpod for state management  
- Add unit testing and widget testing
